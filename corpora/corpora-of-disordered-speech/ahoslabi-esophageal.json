      "Description": "This corpus primarily consists of recordings of 31 laryngectomees (27 males and 4 females) pronouncing 100 phonetically balanced sentences.\nEsophageal voices were recorded in a soundproof recording cubicle with a Neuman microphone.\nThe corpus also includes parallel recordings of the  sentences by 9 healthy speakers (6 males and 3 females) to facilitate  speech processing tasks that require small parallel corpora, such as  voice conversion or synthetic speech adaptation. Apart from the  sentences, the database also contains 4 sustained vowels and a small set of isolated words (14) which can be very valuable for research on  esophageal speech analysis, diagnosis and evaluation.
