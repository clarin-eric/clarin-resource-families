      "Description": "This corpus contains essays from various education establishments in Sweden for non-Swedish speaking adult learners.\nAside from the automatic linguistic annotation, the corpus is manually annotated at the following levels: pseudonymization, normalization, and correction annotation. See <a href=\"https://spraakbanken.github.io/swell-release-v1/Metadata-SweLL\">the metadata description</a> for further details on the automatic and manual annotation. While the SweLL-pilot corpus was collected in 2006–2016, SweLL-gold was collected in 2017–2020.\nThe corpus is available through the Browse Korp and for download in Språkbanken Text / the SweLL infrastructure through an individual application form.",
