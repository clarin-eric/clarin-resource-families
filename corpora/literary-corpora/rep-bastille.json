      "Description": "This corpus contains République-Bastille, a novel by Melpo Axioti. This French text is of particular linguistic interest since it is a text written in a language other than the author's mother tongue and is suited for research on bilingualism and self-translation. It would be worth measuring the naturalness of the language with computational tools, for example.\nThe corpus is available for download from clarin:el.",
