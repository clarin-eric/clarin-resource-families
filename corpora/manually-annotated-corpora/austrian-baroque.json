      "Description": "This historical corpus contains sermons from 1650 to 1750. For linguistic annotation, each individual token was automatically assigned to a morphosyntactic word class using the <a href=\"https://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/TreeTagger/\">TreeTagger</a> software. As a classification system, the 54-part Stuttgart-TÃ¼bingen TagSet (<a href=\"https://homepage.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/Stephen.Berman/Korpuslinguistik/Tagsets-STTS.html\">STTS</a>) was used. For lemmatization , a normalized basic word form was used for each token and the <a href=\"http://www.duden.de/\">Duden</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.dwb.uni-trier.de/\">German dictionary by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm</a> were used as reference works. The part-of-speech tagging and lemmatization was then manually checked.\nThe corpus is available through a dedicated concordancer.",
