      "Description": "This training corpus contains about 500,000 tokens manually annotated on the levels of tokenisation, sentence segmentation, morphosyntactic tagging, lemmatisation and named entities. About half of the corpus is also manually annotated with syntactic dependencies. A subset of the syntactically annotated corpus is also annotated for multi-word expressions. Furthermore, about a fifth of the corpus is annotated with semantic role labels.\nThe annotation formalisms followed in the hr500k corpus are (1) the <a href=\"https://nl.ijs.si/ME/V6/msd/\">MULTEXT-East V6</a> morphosyntactic specifications for the Serbo-Croatian macro-language, (2) the <a href=\"http://universaldependencies.org/guidelines.html\">UDv2 Guidelines</a>, (3) the <a href=\"https://nl.ijs.si/janes/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SlovenianNER-eng-v1.1.pdf\">Janes annotation guidelines for named entities</a>, (4) the <a href=\"https://parsemefr.lis-lab.fr/parseme-st-guidelines/1.3/\">PARSEME guidelines for annotating multi-word expressions</a> and (4) the <a href=\"https://www.sdjt.si/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/JTDH-2018_Gantar-et-al_Towards-Semantic-Role-Labeling-in-Slovene-and-Croatian.pdf\">semantic role labelling annotation protocol for Slovenian and Croatian</a>.\nThe corpus is available for download from the CLARIN.SI repository.",
