      "Description": "This corpus contains multi modal recordings of 86 actors who use the SmartKom system. SmartKom Public is comparable to a traditional public phone booth but equipped with additional intelligent communication devices. Naive users were asked to test a 'prototype' for a market study not knowing that the system was in fact controlled by two human operators. They were asked to solve two tasks in a period of 4,5 min while they were left alone with the system. The instruction was kept to a minimum, in fact the user only knew that the system is able to understand speech, gestures and even mimic expressions and should more or less communicate like a human.",
