      "Description": "This corpus contains 25 dialogues of interlocutors (50), who engage in a spatial communication task combining direction-giving and sight description. The stimulus is a model of a town presented in a Virtual Reality (VR) environment. Upon finishing a “bus ride” through the VR town along five landmarks, a router explained the route as well as the wayside landmarks to an unknown and naive follower.\nThe corpus is available for download from the BAS CLARIN-D repository.",
