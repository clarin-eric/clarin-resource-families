      "Description": "The theme of the dialogues is the description of routes and places in Marseille and Aix-en-Provence in France. The corpus is composed of 3 dialogues in LSF and 3 dialogues in French. Each dyad is composed of a moderator and a speaker. There is a single moderator for French and two moderators for LSF.  The recording equipment consisted of 3 cameras and 2 headset microphones for the French spoken part. The corpus is composed of 6 sessions: 1, 2 and 3 for French and 4, 5, 6 for LSF. Each dyad is composed of a speaker located on the right of the overview noted A, and a moderator located on the left of the overview noted B. Thus, for session 1, the speakers are conversing in French, A1 is the speaker located on the right of the overview and B1 is the moderator located on the left of the overview. For each session there are 4 video files (mp4/AVC): 1 for the speaker, 1 for the moderator, 1 which gives a profile view of the two speakers, the overview, and 1 which is a montage of these 3 videos. All the files are synchronised. For the LSF part, there is no sound track in the videos. For the French part, there are 2 sound files (wave) in addition to the video files, 1 per speaker.  The first 3 videos do not contain a sound track. Only the editing video contains sound, that of the speaker on the right in the right channel and that of the moderator on the left in the left channel.",
