Previously, the corpus was only available through the special-purpose video annotation tool <a href=\"https://www.mpi.nl/corpus/html/elan/index.html\">ELAN</a>. The aim of this corpus is to provide a picture of what sign language sentences look like, but also contribute new characters and variants to the <a href=\"https://snd.gu.se/en/catalogue/study/ext0408\">Swedish Sign Language Dictionary</a>. It can also be used to develop teaching materials.",
