Native German speakers called a voice portal from their private phone, and read text + answered some open questions. The purpose of the corpus is the automatic detection of gender and/or age (7 mixed classes ranging from 7 - 80 years). The corpus contains the voices of 945 German speakers (approx. minimum of 100 speakers per class), each delivering 18 speech items in up to six different sessions.",
