      "Description": "This is an ASR corpus for Icelandic oral histories.\nThe corpus contains 210 unique speakers, 90 women and 120 men (plus the interviewers: 14 men and 1 woman), but the total audio length with each individual speaker varies quite a lot with three men accounting for one third of the entire data. The age ranges from 38 to 99, but most of the speakers are 60+ (94.8%) and the average age of the speakers is 77 years. This ratio is unprecedented in all existing corpora for Icelandic speech (cf. 4.8% of speakers in Samrómur are 60+) and makes Gamli an important addition to that collection.\nThe corpus is available for download from the CLARIN-IS repository.",
