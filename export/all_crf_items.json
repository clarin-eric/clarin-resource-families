The file and sentence identifiers are the same as in the original RSDO corpus. The labels added to the sentences included in the dataset denote: 0: Non-definition; 1: Weak definition; 2: Definition.\nThe dataset consists of two parts: 1. RSDO-def-random employed a random sampling strategy, with 14 definitions, 98 weak-definitions and 849 non-definitions; and 2. RSDO-def-larger added sentences to the random one by the pattern-based definition extraction as presented in Pollak et al. (2014). It contains 169 definitions, 214 weak-definitions and 872 non-definitions. Both parts were manually annotated by five terminographers. In case of discrepancies between annotators, a consensus was reached and the final label was confirmed by all five annotators.

The crawler is available at <a href=\"https://github.com/macocu/MaCoCu-crawler\">MaCoCu GitHub channel</a>. Considerable effort was devoted into cleaning the extracted text to provide a high-quality web corpus. This was achieved by removing <a href=\"https://corpus.tools/wiki/Justext\">boilerplate</a> and <a href=\"https://corpus.tools/wiki/Onion\">near-duplicated paragraphs</a>, discarding very short texts as well as texts that are not in the target language. Furthermore, samples from the largest 1,500 domains were manually checked and bad domains, such as machine-translated domains, were removed.\nThe dataset is characterized by extensive metadata which allows filtering the dataset based on text quality and <a href=\"https://github.com/bitextor/monotextor\">other criteria</a>, making the corpus highly useful for corpus linguistics studies, as well as for training language models and other language technologies. In XML format, each document is accompanied by the following metadata: title, crawl date, url, domain, file type of the original document, distribution of languages inside the document, and a fluency score based on a language model. The text of each document is divided into paragraphs that are accompanied by metadata on the information whether a paragraph is a heading or not, metadata on the paragraph quality (labels, such as \"short\" or \"good\", assigned based on paragraph length, URL and stopword density via the <a href=\"https://corpus.tools/wiki/Justext\">jusText tool</a>) and fluency (score between 0 and 1, assigned with the <a href=\"https://github.com/bitextor/monocleaner\">Monocleaner tool</a>), the automatically identified language of the text in the paragraph, and information whether the paragraph contains sensitive information (identified via the <a href=\"https://github.com/bitextor/biroamer\">Biroamer tool</a>). As opposed to the previous version in the case of corpora in version 2.0, this version has more accurate metadata on languages of the texts, which was achieved by using <a href=\"https://github.com/CLD2Owners/cld2\">Google's Compact Language Detector 2 (CLD2)</a>, a high-performance language detector supporting many languages.

Version 1.1 contains sentences for 10 languages: Bulgarian, Danish, English, Spanish, Estonian, Hungarian, Italian, Dutch, Portuguese, and Slovene.\nThe corpus was compiled by automatically extracting a set of sentences from WikiMatrix (Schwenk et al., 2019), a large open-access collection of parallel sentences derived from Wikipedia, using an automatic approach based on multilingual sentence embeddings. The sentences were manually validated according to specific formal, lexical and semantic criteria (e.g. by removing incorrect punctuation, morphological errors, notes in square brackets and etymological information typically provided in Wikipedia pages). To obtain a satisfying semantic coverage, we filtered out sentences with less than 5 words and less than 2 polysemous words were filtered out. Subsequently, in order to obtain datasets in the other nine target languages, for each selected sentence in English, the corresponding WikiMatrix translation into each of the other languages was retrieved. If no translation was available, the English sentence was translated manually. The resulting corpus is comprised of 2,024 sentences for each language.\nThe sentences were tokenized, lemmatized, and tagged with POS tags using <a href=\"https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/services/udpipe/\">UDPipe v2.6</a>. Senses were annotated using <a href=\"https://elexis.babelscape.com/\">LexTag,/a>: each content word (noun, verb, adjective, and adverb) was assigned a sense from among the available senses from the sense inventory selected for the language (see below) or BabelNet.

All the crawling process was carried out by the <a href=\"https://github.com/macocu/MaCoCu-crawler\">MaCoCu crawler</a>. Websites containing documents in both target languages were identified and processed using the tool <a href=\"https://github.com/bitextor/bitextor\">Bitextor</a>. Considerable effort was devoted into cleaning the extracted text to provide a high-quality parallel corpus. This was achieved by removing boilerplate and near-duplicated paragraphs and documents that are not in one of the targeted languages. Document and segment alignment as implemented in Bitextor were carried out, and <a href=\"https://github.com/bitextor/bifixer\">Bifixer</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/bitextor/bicleaner-ai\">BicleanerAI</a> were used for fixing, cleaning, and deduplicating the final version of the corpus.\nThe corpus is available in three formats: two sentence-level formats, TXT and TMX, and a document-level TXT format. When relevant, in each format, the texts are separated based on the script into two files: a Latin and a Cyrillic subcorpus. TMX is an XML-based format and TXT is a tab-separated format. They both consist of pairs of source and target segments (one or several sentences) and additional metadata. The following metadata is included in both sentence-level formats: - source and target document URL; - paragraph ID which includes information on the position of the sentence in the paragraph and in the document (e.g., \"p35:77s1/3\" which means \"paragraph 35 out of 77, sentence 1 out of 3\"); - quality score as provided by the tool Bicleaner AI (a likelihood of a pair of sentences being mutual translations, provided with a score between 0 and 1); - similarity score as provided by the sentence alignment tool Bleualign (value between 0 and 1); - personal information identification (\"biroamer-entities-detected\"): segments containing personal information are flagged, so final users of the corpus can decide whether to use these segments; - translation direction and machine translation identification (\"translation-direction\"): the source segment in each segment pair was identified by using a <a href=\"https://github.com/RikVN/TranslationDirection\">probabilistic model</a>, which also determines if the translation has been produced by a machine-translation system; - a DSI class (\"dsi\"): information whether the segment is connected to any of <a href=\"https://github.com/RikVN/DSI\">Digital Service Infrastructure (DSI) classes</a> (e.g., cybersecurity, e-health, e-justice, open-data-portal), defined by the Connecting Europe Facility; - English language variant: the language variant of English (British or American, using a <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/abclf/\">lexicon-based English variety classifier</a>) was identified on document and domain level. Furthermore, the sentence-level TXT format provides additional metadata: - web domain of the text; - source and target document title; - the date when the original file was retrieved; - the original type of the file (e.g., \"html\"), from which the sentence was extracted; - paragraph quality (labels, such as \"short\" or \"good\", assigned based on paragraph length, URL and stopword density via the <a href=\"https://corpus.tools/wiki/Justext\">jusText tool</a>); - information whether the sentence is a heading or not in the original document.\nThe document-level TXT format provides pairs of documents identified to contain parallel data. In addition to the parallel documents (in base64 format), the corpus includes the following metadata: source and target document URL, a DSI category and the English language variant (British or American). As opposed to the previous version in the case of corpora in version 2.0, this version has more accurate metadata on languages of the texts, which was achieved by using <a href=\"https://github.com/CLD2Owners/cld2\">Google's Compact Language Detector 2 (CLD2)</a>, a high-performance language detector supporting many languages. Other tools, used for web corpora creation and curation, have been updated as well, resulting in an even cleaner corpus. The new version also provides additional metadata, such as the position of the sentence in the paragraph and document, and information whether the sentence is related to a DSI. Moreover, the corpus is now also provided in a document-level format.\nThe document-level TXT format provides pairs of documents identified to contain parallel data. In addition to the parallel documents (in base64 format), the corpus includes the following metadata: source and target document URL, a DSI category and the English language variant (British or American).\nThe ALBANIAN-ENGLISH parallel corpus MaCoCu-sq-en 1.0 was built by crawling the \".al\" internet top-level domain in 2022.
