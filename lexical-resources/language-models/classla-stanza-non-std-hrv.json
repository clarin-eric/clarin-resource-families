      "Description": "The model for morphosyntactic annotation of non-standard Croatian was built with the <a href=\"https://github.com/clarinsi/classla\">CLASSLA-Stanza tool</a> by training on the <a href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/11356/1792\">hr500k training corpus</a> and the <a href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/11356/1793\">ReLDI-NormTagNER-hr corpus</a>, using the <a href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/11356/1790\">CLARIN.SI-embed.hr word embeddings</a>. These corpora were additionally augmented for handling missing diacritics by repeating parts of the corpora with diacritics removed. The model produces simultaneously UPOS, FEATS and XPOS (MULTEXT-East) labels. The estimated F1 of the XPOS annotations is ~92.49.\nThe model is available for download from the CLARIN.SI repository.",
