These corpora were additionally augmented for handling missing diacritics by repeating parts of the corpora with diacritics removed. The model produces simultaneously UPOS, FEATS and XPOS (MULTEXT-East) labels. The estimated F1 of the XPOS annotations is ~92.17.\nThe model is available for download from the CLARIN.SI repository.",
