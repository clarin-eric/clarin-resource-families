      "Description": "The model for morphosyntactic annotation of non-standard Serbian was built with the <a href=\"https://github.com/clarinsi/classla\">CLASSLA-Stanza tool</a> by training on the <a href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/11356/1200\">SETimes.SR training corpus</a> combined with the <a href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/11356/1794\">Serbian non-standard training corpus ReLDI-NormTagNER-sr</a> and the <a href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/11356/1792\">hr500k training corpus</a> and using the <a href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/11356/1789\">CLARIN.SI-embed.sr word embeddings</a>. These corpora were additionally augmented for handling missing diacritics by repeating parts of the corpora with diacritics removed. The model produces simultaneously UPOS, FEATS and XPOS (MULTEXT-East) labels. The estimated F1 of the XPOS annotations is ~92.64.\nThe model is available for download from the CLARIN.SI repository.",
