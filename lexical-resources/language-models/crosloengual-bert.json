State of the art tool representing words/tokens as contextually dependent word embeddings, used for various NLP classification tasks by finetuning the model end-to-end. CroSloEngual BERT are neural network weights and configuration files in pytorch format (i.e. to be used with pytorch library).\nThe model is available for download from the CLARIN.SI repository.",
