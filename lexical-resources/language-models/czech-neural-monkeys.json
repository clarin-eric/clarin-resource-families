      "Description": "These models are for the <a href=\"https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/neuralmonkey\">Neural Monkey</a> toolkit for Czech and English, solving four NLP tasks: machine translation, image captioning, sentiment analysis, and summarization. The models are trained on standard datasets and achieve state-of-the-art or near state-of-the-art performance in the tasks. The same models can also be invoked via <a href=\"https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/grants/lsd\">an online demo</a>.\nThis entry also includes models for automatic news summarization for Czech and English. The Czech models were trained using the <a href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/11234/1-2615\">SumeCzech dataset</a>, while the English models were trained using the <a href=\"https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/cnn-daily-mail-1\">CNN-Daily Mail</a> corpus, using the standard recurrent sequence-to-sequence architecture.\nThe models are available for download from the LINDAT repository.",
