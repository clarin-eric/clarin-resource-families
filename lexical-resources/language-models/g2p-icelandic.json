The models are delivered with scripts for automatic transcription of Icelandic in the standard pronunciation variation, in the northern variation, north-east variation, and the south variation. To run the scripts the user needs to install <a href=\"https://github.com/grammatek/g2p-lstm\">Fairseq</a>.",
