      "Description": "This lexicon consists of a pickled dictionary of 111,660 lemmas, and maps these lemmas to their corresponding word forms. This inflectional data lookup module serves as an optional component within the <a href=\"https://github.com/clarinsi/cordex/\">cordex library</a> that significantly improves the quality of the results.\nEach word form in the dictionary is accompanied by its MULTEXT-East morphosytactic descriptions, relevant features (custom features extracted from morphosytactic descriptions with the help of <a href=\"https://gitea.cjvt.si/generic/conversion_utils\">Conversion utilities tool</a> and its frequency within the <a href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/11356/1320\"> Gigafida 2.0 corpus</a>, or Gigafida 1.0 when other information is unavailable. The dictionary is used to select the most frequent word form of a lemma that satisfies additional filtering conditions (ie. find the most utilized word form of lemma \"centralen\" in singular, i.e.\"centralni\").\nThis resource is available for download from the CLARIN.SI repository.",
