The coded properties are organized in columns. Verbs in the database are coded for the following properties: root information, whether or not the verb has prefixes and the identity of the included prefix(es), whether or not the verb has suffixes and the identity of the included suffix(es) etc. All coded properties are explained in the accompanying pdf file.\nThis resource is available for download from the CLARIN.SI repository.",
