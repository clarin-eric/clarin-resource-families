There are two models for this NER available for download through the CLARIN-IS repository; the <a href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12537/118\">ELECTRA-base model</a>, which achieves F1-score of ~91.9 on the test set for MIM-GOLD-NER, and the <a href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12537/159\">Ensamble model</a>, which uses a the IceBERT language model from Mi√∞eind as its primary model, but it also offers the possibility to use 3 other transformer language models with it ( ELECTRA-base, convbert-small, and multilingual-BERT) and combines them with <a href=\"http://www.malfong.is/index.php?lang=en&pg=combitagger\">CombiTagger</a>.",
