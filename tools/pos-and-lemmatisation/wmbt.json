      "Description": "This tool uses the <a href=\"https://languagemachines.github.io/timbl/\">TiMBL</a> API as the underlying memory-based learning implementation. The features for classification are generated by using the <a href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/11321/34\">WCCL</a> formalism. The tool uses a tiered tagging approach. Grammatical class is disambiguated first, then subsequent attributes (as defined in a config file) are taken care of. Each attribute may be supplied a different set of features. The software package comes with default configurations for KIPI/IPIC and <a href=\"http://nkjp.pl/poliqarp/help/ense2.html\">NKJP</a> tagsets.",
